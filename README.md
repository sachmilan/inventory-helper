# Inventory Helper

## Description

-  In today's busy era, nobody have time to go through files and do the inventory. So this gave me an idea to create an application which will create the inventory list for you.

- To achieve my goal, I created this application. In this application you can type in the contents, and it will make the inventory for you.

- It will make the hectic life of today's human a bit easy. Thus giving them a siegh of relief, as they do not have to worry about inventory anymore.

- Java script was totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
